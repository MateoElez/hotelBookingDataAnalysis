# Bachelor Thesis - Tourist Sector Domain Data Analysis Using Machine Learning

The tourism sector can benefit from the quality application of data analysis. Quality insight into the dynamics of accommodation reservations, demand and customer needs can give the tourism service provider the opportunity to make business decisions that will on the one hand, further raise the quality of the offer and customer satisfaction, and on the other hand, result higher profits. The task of this paper is to collect a data set related to the tourism sector, to implement exploratory analysis of these data and develop a predictive model for selected dependent variables. The final solution needs to be implemented in the form of a program script that will implement the developed models and evaluate their effectiveness with comparative analysis of used methods.

Bachelor thesis explains basics of machine learning and focuses on three models: Logistic Regression, Bayes Naive CLassifier and Decision Tree.
First is theory part and then practical part, where I explain exploratory analysis and results of machine learning models I made.
